# Status Security Best Practice Guide

This document is intended to provide you with the information you need to protect yourself while using Status and other blockchain technology. It is open source and editable by anyone - please help us and the growing community by contributing as you feel fit.

Remember - by removing unnecessary intermediaries, we are able to take control of our digital lives. We can communicate free of censorship. We can transact on our terms. Our data is ours and ours alone. However, this means we are responsible for protecting ourselves.

## Personal Security

### Status Account Setup
* ***Remember your password!*** Write it down and keep it in a safe place. Use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password.  We don’t store your password anywhere. You and only you have access to your password so make sure you remember it. Don’t reuse passwords - Use unique, secure passwords that are 8+ characters and use a variety of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  You will need this password to open the app and confirm transactions
* ***Back up your 12 word recovery phrase***. You will only have one chance to write this down, so make sure you write it down on a piece of paper offline when you create your account. Don’t take a screenshot or type it somewhere online where it can be compromised. Write it down and store it offline in a secure place. Remember, this phrase is used to recover your entire account. Anyone who gains access to this can access your account and the funds held within it. Status does not store this phrase anywhere, so we can’t help you recover your account if you lose your recovery phrase. For all intents and purposes, this phrase _is_ your Status wallet and identity.
* ***Turn on Browser Privacy Mode*** - In your profile settings, you can enable "Browser Privacy Mode". This ensures X,Y,Z

### Status Wallet Setup
* ***Remember your Three Word Signing Phrase*** - remember this phrase and make sure you see it every time you send a transaction. You will be prompted to confirm these three words every time you sign a transaction. If you see a different three words, or no words at all, do NOT confirm the transaction. This three word signing phrase is to protect you from any phishing scam and sending funds to a malicious account.

### Sending & Receiving Crypto Transactions
* ***Make sure you see your 3 Word Signing Phrase.*** As mentioned above, everytime you send a transaction, you will be presented these three words. Only confirm the transaction if the three words are correct. If they are different words, or no words at all, do not confirm the transaction, and report this activity to security@status.im for further investigation.
* ***Only send crypt payments to trusted sources.*** You are able to send transactions directly from within Status. You can choose recipients from within your contacts, scanning a QR code, or manually entering a recipient wallet address. Be sure you know the source you are sending funds too.
* ***Be sure you know who is sending you crypto transaction.*** You are able to receive crypto funds directly from within Status. You can share your wallet address or the QR code from within the wallet to receive funds. Be sure you know who is scanning this code or taking this wallet address. NOTE - the wallet address is a different code from your contact code.
* ***Do not store large quantities of crypto on your Status Wallet.*** You should never store massive quantities of funds on your wallet. Think of it like a physical wallet. Only store what you need to interact. Keep large amounts of cryptocurrency offline in cold storage with a hardwallet such as a Ledger or Trezor.
